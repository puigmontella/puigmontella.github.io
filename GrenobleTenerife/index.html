      <p align="justify">  In the late summer of 2023 I decided to move to Tenerife with my partner. I have lived in Grenoble for the last 8 years and I thought that the best way to move to Tenerife was to embark on a journey of 2400km by bicycle. This trip gifted me countless memories and adventures. I tried to capture some of them on this website. </p>
<p>For those seeking more detailed info, GPS tracks and full path, everything is available  <a href="https://www.komoot.com/collection/2440416/-grenoble-el-masnou-tenerife">here</a> .</p>

<h3 id="day-1---grenoble---dévoluy">Day 1 - Grenoble - Dévoluy:</h3>

<p align="justify"> Grenoble, home for the last 8 years, is my starting point. Following the Drag river upstream, I leave behind both mountains and memories. The unbroken heat and slope persist until I reach Lac de Monteynard. From there I can still see the most emblematic peaks of Vercors and Chartreuse, faithful companions throughout my years in Grenoble. The familiar silhouettes of Sénépy, Peyrouse, and Mont Aiguille fade into the distance. I stop near La Mure to have lunch and start the first descent that helps me regain my strength to face the rest of the ascent. I pass near the lac du Sautet and the sunlight begins to recede. The last climb of the day goes through a wide valley between the giants of the Obiou and the Pierroux peaks. Half way up my legs are still full of energy but the darkness halts my progress and I decide to camp in the middle of the vallée du Dévoluy.  </p>

<h3 id="day-2---dévoluy---lac-de-serre-ponçon"> Day 2 - Dévoluy - Lac de Serre-Ponçon:</h3>

<p align="justify">
I start the day quite late, feeling the relentless sun on me since the beginning. After an hour of climbing, I reach the col du Festre. I have about 20 km of downhill ahead of me, which brings a big smile to my face. I go at full speed through the last gray and rocky peaks of the massif of Dévoluy.  I opt for lesser-traveled roads to bypass Gap, following the course of La Durancel river.  My legs are exhausted and my back hurts but I still have one last climb to reach the campsite near Lac de Serre-Ponçon. Unfortunately, the climb is full of cars and motorbikers that make me a little nervous. Luckily, I make it without problems and reach the destination before the orange glow of the evening fades out.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day2.jpg" alt="day2_bikeGreTen" title="day2_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="day-3---lac-de-serre-ponçon---mezel"> Day 3 - Lac de Serre-Ponçon - Mezel:</h3>
<p align="justify"> The day kicks off with an intense ascent. Two hours of battling the sun, sweat, and hard work lead me to the mountain pass marking the start of the Alpes de l'Haute-Provence natural park. Lunchtime arrives near Le Grand Puy ski resort, offering a breathtaking view of Roche Close and la Mournière peaks. After an energetic meal, it's time to descend. The way ahead is a long road winding through mountains and gorges. I pass through the awe-inspiring stone formations of Clues de Barles, sculpted by water across millennia. Then I reach Digne-les-Bains in search of accommodation. Disappointed by the options, I opt to push forward. Ten kilometers later, I stumble upon a motocross circuit bustling with vans that welcome me and offer me a spot to spend the night.   </p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day3.jpg" alt="day3_bikeGreTen" title="day3_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="-day-4---mezel---correns">  Day 4 - Mezel - Correns:</h3>

<p align="justify"> Today's  route starts amidst lavender fields. Though they're not fully in bloom, leaving behind the alpine vegetation for the iconic landscapes of Provence fills me with excitement. A hard and steep ascent towards the village of Saint-Jurs serves as a reminder of the many kilometers my legs have completed in the recent days, discouraging me from seeking more mountain peaks. Crossing endless fields of lavender, my excitement gradually wanes and it is replaced by a sense of monotony as the scenery repeats itself for hours and kilometers. Eventually, my route culminates at Lac de Sainte-Croix in the heart of the Verdon natural park. Although it's hard, I manage to find a shaded spot to enjoy lunch. The landscapes I traverse in the afternoon, while slightly less spectacular, still carry the unique charm of Provence. I decide to do the last 10 kilometers on a sandy track through a sparsely forested area resembling a savanna. There are more and more rocks and the rear wheel gives up... First flat tire of the trip! After changing it, a mere kilometer later, another puncture deflates my hopes. Choosing not to rush, I decide to cover the final 3 kilometers on foot beside my bike as the campsite where I plan to sleep is nearby. I arrive almost at dusk but with enough time to inspect the wheel and fix the puncture and tire damage with more peace of mind. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day4.jpg" alt="day4_bikeGreTen" title="day4_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="-day-5---correns---marseille">  Day 5 - Correns - Marseille:</h3>

<p align="justify"> I depart from Correns, following a road alongside the L'Argens river, enjoying the last moments of serene nature before the hectic and stressful metropolis of Marseille. The roads and streets are becoming more and more busy and cars are everywhere. I traverse the northern part of the Sainte-Baume natural park. Despite sporadic wooded areas and vineyards, I don't have the same feeling of stillness and tranquility as I had in the Alps. A seemingly endless ascent leads me to the village of Cassis, marking the gateway to the renowned Calanques park, my final route to Marseille. Despite its natural status, the park is congested with cars and motorbikes, making the scenic coastal journey a bit too stressful. Luckily, this area is familiar to me, and I'm aware that only a few kilometers stand between me and the center of Marseille, where a well-deserved shower and a comfortable bed await my arrival. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day5.jpg" alt="day5_bikeGreTen" title="day5_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="-day-6---marseille---salin-de-girau">  Day 6 - Marseille - Salin-de-Girau:</h3>
<p align="justify"> After a few days of rest, I've regained my strength. Plus, in the upcoming days I will be accompanied by one of my best friends, and not much elevation gain is expected before the Pyrenees. Today is not a day with much nature, it's all about navigating away from Marseille's urban sprawl. We pass through small hills leading to Berre Lake. This lake is heavily urbanized - if not houses, then industries dominate.  To get away from the busiest roads we decide to take paths that cross some salt ponds. It's not the fastest, but the journey becomes more entertaining and safer. Despite the stagnant water's smell, we choose to eat lunch by the ponds; it's preferable to be amidst flamingos and stinky ponds than next to a busy national road. In the afternoon, we are forced to pedal alongside a road crowded with trucks until we reach the Rhône river's mouth. A free ferry for cyclists brings us to the other side, where the Camargue region begins and we find a calm spot to spend the night. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day6.jpg" alt="day6_bikeGreTen" title="day6_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="-day-7---salin-de-giraud---montpellier">  Day 7 - Salin-de-Giraud - Montpellier:</h3>
<p align="justify"> We set out in the morning crossing rice fields and pools of water full of flamingos. We expected a more diverse landscape, yet the delta's sight is monotonous as the day goes on. Luckily, the favorable wind and minimal elevation gain of no more than 50 meters helps to overcome the boredom. After lunch we come across the Canal du Rhône à Sète,  which brings us to a different scenery: cycling paths, old boats, and a sun that had been hidden during the early morning. Following the canal, we reach Aigues-Mortes, a fortified town surrounded by canals and Rhône's ponds. Passing through, we join the Eurovelo 8 route, a cycling path that runs along the coast of the European side of the  Mediterranean sea. For approximately 10 kilometers, we traverse a coastal bar  that lies between the Mediterranean Sea and the Estany d'Or to finally enter the metropolitan area of Montpellier.
 </p>

<h3 id="-day-8---montpellier---capestang">  Day 8 - Montpellier - Capestang:</h3>
<p align="justify">  After a day of rest in Montpellier, my father joins me and my friend Marta heads back home. Heading south, we traverse coastal bars along sandy and gravel paths that run between waters. Much of the morning is spent following these paths, flanked by the Mediterranean on the left and several salt and marine ponds on the right. It's very windy but most of the time it is tailwind and helps us reach the tourist city of Sète without much effort. We stop for a half an hour near the fort of Saint-Pierre where we recover our strength while watching the waves break against the rocks and the walls of the fort. Continuing along the coast, we pass various beaches until reaching Agde, where we pause for lunch. A few drops fall in the afternoon, but they do not prevent us from continuing and climbing the path that follows alongside Canal du Midi. We cross vineyards, many locks, several bridges and leave behind boats that navigate the canal. Finally, we arrive at the Capestang campsite where we spend the night.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day8.jpg" alt="day8_bikeGreTen" title="day8_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="-day-9---capestang---tautavel">  Day 9 - Capestang - Tautavel:</h3>
<p align="justify">  I am alone again but I am accompanied by a breeze that pushes me during the first kilometers. Although my initial plan was to spend the day on the Canal du Midi in the direction of Carcassonne, I opt for a change and head south, facing the first hills that precede the Pyrenees. The day advances between secondary roads that lead me through changing landscapes, from vineyards, castles, canyons and striking rock formations. As evening approaches, the winding path leads me amidst small hills and karst structures, offering a glimpse of the Pyrenees' silhouette emerging on the distant horizon. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day9.jpg" alt="day9_bikeGreTen" title="day9_bikeGreTen" /></p>

<h3 id="-day-10---tautavel---roquefort-de-sault">  Day 10 - Tautavel - Roquefort-de-Sault:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
I resume my journey along a narrow road that winds through vineyards.  It is harvest time and there are many people in a region that is usually empty.  The first kilometers are pleasant, surrounded by the green vineyards and the emblematic views of the castle of Quéribus located on a very steep rocky peak. By mid-morning, I merge onto a busier road, a straight line of 40 kilometers where the only attraction is the red train of the pays Cathare et du Fenouillèdes. In addition, a relentless headwind drains me both physically and mentally. I pause in Axat for lunch and recharge my body.  I realize that I have to reconsider the route since I don't have much time or strength left to get where I had planned. Just 10 kilometers remain, unfortunately, they're all uphill.  I cross the gorges of Saint Georges and continue to climb between cliffs and rocks . My legs  tell me they had  enough and ask me  to stop. Eventually, I reach Roquefort-de-Sault safely, finding myself the only person at the deserted campsite.
 </p>

<h3 id="-day-11---roquefort-de-sault---llo">  Day 11 - Roquefort-de-Sault - Llo:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
I wake up with more energy than yesterday to face the second stage of the Pyrenees. The day begins foggy and I slowly climb up to the col du Garavel. The reward? Some downhill curves that give me rest and a touch of amusement.  The fun ends soon and a long ascent awaits me without compassion. The road, despite being quite wide, it's not very busy, allowing me to climb at my own pace and take breaks whenever I need to. The path winds between mountains following the upstream course of the Aude river until reaching the Puyvalador reservoir. From there the slope softens and the road  opens into a broad valley  that passes through numerous coniferous forests.
 Eventually, the road  takes me to the lake of Matermale where I stop for a well-deserved lunch. The fog continues but is not dense enough to hide the beauty of the Pyrenees. I decide to go around the lake on a sandy path and tackle the last climb of the day. The fog begins to disappear and from the highest point, at the Quillana pass, I have breathtaking views of the Puigmal and the rest of the peaks of the olla de Núria. I go down the streets and roads that pass through Llo. Eventually I reach the campsite exhausted. The fog returns and I realize I made the mistake of not putting sun cream so my whole face is burnt...

<h3 id="-day-12---llo---ripoll">  Day 12 - Llo - Ripoll:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
Today is the last day of my Pyrenees adventure but I still have the highest and probably most spectacular mountain passes. The stage begins bordering agricultural fields and I continue to pedal through the wide valley that takes me to Puigcerdà and Alp where I have to stop to buy food. I return to the road and begin the ascent to La Molina along a road that I have done many times by car but it is unexplored by bike. The side of the road is narrow and despite not being a very busy place I don't fully enjoy the environment due to the traffic of passing cars.  However, near La Molina I take paths further away from the traffic and enjoy the splendid views of the Pyrenees. Once I leave behind the ski resort of La Molina I head towards the Creueta pass, a demanding and long climb.  Yet, the sunny day eases the ascent while I contemplate the  grassy rugged mountains. Plus, a couple of marmots pop out to greet me. The descent is beautiful and delights me with views of the sea of mountains of Ripollès and Berguedà. While I am having fun on the way down, I halt abruptly at the awe-inspiring sight of Pedraforca's imposing silhouette. The snaky curves continue and I leave behind Castellar de n'Hug, Gombren, Campdevanol to finally reach Ripoll. I finish the day with exhausted legs but  my heart overflows with joy from experiencing such a magnificent stage.

<h3 id="-day-13---ripoll---el-masnou">  Day 13 - Ripoll - El Masnou:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
I get up early, it's still dark but I have a long day ahead of me. I set out on a route following the course of the Ter and detour along narrow paths to avoid taking a road congested with cars and trucks. The path becomes steeper and steeper and  more rocks pop up to the point that  I find myself getting off the bike and pushing my bike through this arduous terrain. This scene repeats relentlessly for what feels like eternal 5 kilometers. It takes me more than an hour and a half to complete them. Plus, an electrified fence to keep the herd protected gives me an intense electric shock. I decide that I've had enough and that no matter how beautiful the trail and the surroundings are, I'm not moving forward, and I make the questionable decision to join the major road C-17 for a little distance to save myself from that horrible mountain roller coaster. Once off the C-17, I merge with a parallel road that runs through crops and livestock fields until I reach Vic, where my father joins me  for the final kilometers. When we approach the Montseny massif, we take a path that crosses the gorge between Tagamanent and Figaró, which gives us a changing scenery from wide tracks of reddish earth to narrow paths that cross the river continuously. As we reach Granollers, the  green woods fade away, replaced by the gray of concrete. The road takes us to the canalization of Besós river that we follow downstream until we reach the Mediterranean sea. From there we follow the coastline path that I have  traveled countless times. We eventually arrive at my parents' home, where I'll spend the coming days resting and processing all I've experienced.

<p align="justify">  
Two weeks later I resume the route to the south, today with my father as my cycling partner. The first hour consists of following the coastline cycleway towards Barcelona. We go through the Forum and follow the various cycle paths that border the tourist beaches of Barcelona. We cross the port and turn up Parallel street and then go along a busy road to Hospitalet de Llobregat. Then we follow the path that runs parallel to the Llobregat river. We start a mountainous ascent on sandy paths that become more and more technical and steeper. At some points, the terrain is so demanding that we need to jump off the bike and push them. We pass through Begues, marking our entry into the Garraf natural park. Here, we traverse sandy  tracks and secondary roads as we pedal between limestone rocks, Mediterranean vegetation, and the distant sight of the sea on the horizon. Descending along wide tracks, we eventually reach Sitges, where we reward ourselves with a well-deserved beer.

<h3 id="-day-15---sitges---cambrils">  Day 15 - Sitges - Cambrils:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
I'm back on the road solo. Morning rolls by with a mix of concrete and beach vibes as I go through Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Cubelles, and Cunit. Find a park for lunch, nothing fancy but my stomach is growling. I meet Alma, a fellow biker. We swap stories and tips over lunch. We say goodbye to each other and I hit the road again, sticking close to the coast, weaving through bike lanes, boulevards, and bustling streets. I cross Tarragona and  Salou passing not too far from the silhouettes of the roller coasters of Port Aventura. A last bike lane by the sea between Salou and Cambrils reminds me how touristy this area is. It's getting dark and I decide to stop for the night at the most expensive campsite I've ever come across.

<h3 id="-day-16---cambrils---les-cases-dalcanar">  Day 16 - Cambrils - Les Cases d’Alcanar:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
The day wakes up slowly, unveiling a bright sun and a calm sea next to Miami Platja and L'Hospitalet de l'Infant's shores. I leave the coast for a few kilometers to pass through two iconic cement structures of southern Catalonia: the Vandellòs power station and the water tower. After a stretch on a long national road, I manage to wiggle through the streets of Ametlla de Mar for a sandwich break. I stick close to the sea, though it's out of sight for a while. But things take a rough turn as the service road I'm on becomes a rocky and bumpy path. Had to stop and push the bike. I didn't see that coming on this mostly flat route. After a bit of swearing (which, believe me, isn't very common in me), I stumble upon a massive underground passage, totally forbidden, but I cross it anyway. The tunnel is long, but spacious enough to see the sea on the other side. Exiting, I bump into the gorgeous Aliga beach. I keep skirting the coast till I hit the rice paddies, revealing the Ebre delta's unique landscape. Slowly navigating through the maze of paddies, canals, and salt ponds, I finally get to Amposta and I cross the Ebre river.I stop for a late lunch break and stock up for the next day. On the horizon, the Ports mountain range stands tall, a strong contrast to my flat rides of the past days. I continue south and reach the Casas d'Alcanar where I crash for the night. </p>

<h3 id="-day-17---les-cases-dalcanar---la-mata-de-morella">  Day 17 - Les Cases d’Alcanar - La Mata de Morella:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
I wake up with a headache and all the symptoms of a cold that I was trying to hide until now. I gather some strength with a good breakfast and go up the street in the opposite direction to the sea, a sea that I will not see again until the last stage of the journey. A gradual ascent takes me between fields and olive groves, snaking along sandy tracks and narrow roads.  I stop at Xert for a sandwich and grab some pills for my throat. I'm exhausted and there's still more than half of the stage ahead. From this moment I join a very busy regional road that goes into the Ports area and its particular mountain landscapes. I've driven this road plenty of times by car but biking is a whole different experience. I discover that I can't cycle on a new viaduct that they've built and that would allow me shortcut the long road. I am forced to take a bunch of extra curves, but luckily no cars are in sight. I even have lunch in the middle of the road without a soul bothering me!  I am feeling worse by the minute, but lunch gives me a boost to push on to the Querol port and downhill to the awe-inspiring walled town of Morella. From there I make a slight climb and I follow a busy but beautiful sandy track because the Forcall bridge got wiped out by some floods weeks back. Finally, I arrive in La Mata around 7 pm, and crash at some friends' place for a few days to rest up and recover from the cold.

<p align="justify">  
I leave  La Mata behind after 4 days of rest. I pass quickly to the Aragon region, gradually winding up through curves that lead me to Cantavieja. The climb keeps me entertained, snaking through ravines and steep landscapes. Finally I reach the port of Cuarto Pelado, despite this name (pelado stands for bald/treeless in spanish), the downhill is a lush forest ride. After Fortanete I take a very narrow and twisty road that climbs up again.  The mountain slopes ease up, revealing a wide, treeless valley with cows chilling by Fortanete pass. The descent is a joyride, gentle slopes and just a few bends through a pine-filled valley. I arrive at Linares de Mora, perched on a rock, looking way more majestic than it probably is.  One last climb before Nogueruelas pass, where I grab lunch and rest up for a long and pleasant descent that continues through a landscape marked by a gentle relief until I reach Fonseca. Then, things get steeper, limestone rocks showing up just like they did in the morning. A few kilometers further I arrive at the planned destination where I sleep in the van. No more tent nights from now. My partner is joining me on the road with the van!

<h3 id="-day-19---albentosa---villar-del-humo">  Day 19 - Albentosa - Villar del Humo:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
The sun rises and shines but I'm still feeling worn out, fighting this stubborn cold. The chilly morning and the first trees with yellow leaves remind me that we are in the middle of autumn. The road is climbing, but it's a gentle rise. Plus, the greenish surroundings and the morning sun feel kinda nice. Tracing the river's path I flow till Torrijas. Then, it's a rollercoaster: down and up till Arcos de las Salinas. I pass close to the colorful Javalambre mountain range. A burst of yellow and red hills reminds me of those Purmamarca hills back in Argentina. After that mountain pass,  just like a magic trick, Teruel hills, bare and colorful, morph into steep pine-covered mountains. A descent down a very beautiful narrow road leads me to a very imposing gorge shaped by the Túria river. I pass it over crossing a viaduct tucked in this narrow gorge and find myself for the first time inside the region of Castilla La Mancha. The road twists and turns through rocks, then suddenly, I'm on this wide, straight path. No more mountains, just this sprawling plateau with lush green fields. To the horizon  mountains show their jagged silhouettes in every direction. Past Fuentelespino de Moya, I take some gravel paths, rolling up and down these hills, under a blazing sun. The views are stunning, but the constant bumps and stones are pretty cumbersome. I appreciate being back on the road, a paved track without cars that runs through a sparse pine forest. As the forest gets more abundant, I take this zigzagging road through the mountains to eventually reach Villar del Humo. Evening's approaching, the orange light is fading, so I decide to call it a night by the Cabriel River.

<p align="justify">  
After a cold night I wake up with a headache and accumulated fatigue. I'm not over the cold, and pedaling through the day isn't really helping. The morning passes slowly as I cross leafy hills with a relief that flattens out and loses its green little by little. Among the forgotten remnants of castles and forts, the scene around me is a picture of deserted Spain. Almost without realizing it, the landscape becomes a colorful patchwork of agricultural fields  stretching to the horizon. Somewhere near Motilla del Palancar I take a busy and dull regional road surrounded by a forest of wind turbines. The fields of reddish soil begin to give way to  olive tree fields, a sign I’m headed south.  Olive trees are about to rule the landscape for the next few days. The road keeps rolling without much fuss until Villalgordo del Júcar, a nice spot to spend the night.

<h3 id="-day-21---barrax---génave">  Day 21 - Barrax - Génave:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
The day kicks off in Barrax, after a much-needed rest day  we took the opportunity to find a nicer place to sleep and cut down 50km of my trip.  We spent the night next to one of those classic Castilla-La Mancha windmills. They stand tall, painting a traditional picture against a background of modern wind turbines on the horizon. I spend the morning cruising a fresh, quiet, wide road, cutting through green fields on reddish soil. But then, the landscape morphs into an endless, shadeless straight line under a blazing sun. Finally I  hit Robledo, where my partner and I meet for lunch. We eat on a sandy track, feeling more like a dry riverbed. Just as I'm about to roll out, a flock of sheep swings by and I'm forced to wait a few more minutes before I get back to pedaling. The afternoon's start isn't as smooth as I expect, riding along a busy national road with noisy trucks and cars overtaking me all the time.  Luckily the road goes through a natural environment that, despite not having anything outstanding, the high-toned colors of the sky, forest, rock and land make the views spectacular so I stop many times to take photos. Somewhere past Alcaraz, I take a detour down a sandy path not even marked on my map. Turns out, I've stumbled into the Segura greenway, an old railway line. Bridges, tunnels, even ghostly old stations scatter along this 20km stretch, and I'm the only soul around.  At the end of the day, olive groves start taking over. In fact, we spend the night in a village that lives and thrives on olive oil.

<h3 id="-day-22---génave---úbeda">  Day 22 - Génave - Úbeda:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
We wake up at a motorhome station with all the necessary services and spectacular views of the Segura national park. After a good streak of sunshine, the sky starts to cloud over and it is starting to get cold. In the morning I take the greenway again and make a cycling friend who recommends some paths to avoid taking the national road. The greenway path continues with the same trend as yesterday, gentle slopes and few curves.  Everywhere I look, it's olive trees for kilometers, even scaling hills and mountains. It's crazy how we human beings shape the land to fit our needs. Around noon I join a road that goes up  to Castellar.  Lunchtime with my partner in this mountain-top village, with views of olive groves stretching out to the imposing Segura mountains. From there I take a secondary road that crosses endless olive tree fields. I gotta admit, spending the whole day surrounded by olives, while charming, made things pretty darn monotone and I can't highlight many other things. So, after a day lost in the world of olive trees, I finally rolled into Ubeda. Not that it's a big city, but after days in the quieter corners of Spain, the hustle and bustle impress me. Tonight, we're ditching the van life and sleeping in a hotel, my legs are cheering already!

<h3 id="-day-23---úbeda---bujalance">  Day 23 - Úbeda - Bujalance:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
As expected, the day starts just how yesterday ended: surrounded by more olive trees. But today there is a twist: I ditch the roads for some sandy tracks and paths cutting through the olive groves. More than once the paths literally pass through the middle of the fields and the olive trees act like a shield from that relentless sun. It's more fun to run along these trails but I'm going much slower. Slowly, I make my way until I reach Mengíbar where I cross the Guadalquivir and climb a sandy track that runs over gentle hills. No olives in sight here, just crazy headwind, relentless, making every pedal feel like a marathon. The landscape shows bare hills and no buildings, a constant reminder I'm in one of the most empty and forgotten areas of Spain. I slowly move forward and notice that the sky is getting darker little by little... here comes the rain. Luckily it's only a few drops and I can keep going without getting wet. I continue to push through the sandy paths that have been my companions all day long. I hit a secondary road, back in the olive tree world. The wind is still  howling, freezing me to the bone. But just before I get to Bujalance, hints of clear sky start peeking through. The orange light that precedes sunset gives me the boost I need to reach the town.

<p align="justify">  
The day dawns cold and wet. One of those days you want to stay in bed and not leave the house (van). I start pedaling along an unpopular national road that follows the course of the Guadalquivir river. The cloudy sky announces a storm and a few kilometers later it starts raining heavily. I'm stuck without a shelter in sight. The rain continues until I reach Alcolea. There I hide where I can and wait for the rain to stop.  After a while I continue on ugly and busy roads that pass through the suburbs of Córdoba. The gray color of the concrete and the streets blends with the cloudy sky. Luckily, just before diving into the city chaos, I catch a bike path that crosses Córdoba. I  don't  swing by any famous or emblematic spot, my legs can't handle more pedaling, my back is crying for a break and the cold I still carry in my body wonders why the heck I decided to ride so many kilometers under the rain. I leave Córdoba behind and travel a few more kilometers along an unpleasant national road to Almodóvar del Río where I climb up to an imposing castle that rises above the town. There I have lunch with my partner and I spend the afternoon pedaling on secondary but very busy roads where there is nothing worth mentioning. By the time I reach Tocina, it's about finding a spot to crash for the night.

<p align="justify">  
Today's forecast? Rain, wind and 60-80km/h gusts according to the weather apps. Even so, I decide to hit the road because I've got a good 180 kilometers to go before reaching Huelva, and just two days to pull it off. The first hour on the bike is relatively calm, headwind but little rain. But little by little the wind and the rain intensify and drops are coming down like there's no tomorrow. I spend two hours riding along the side of a busy road with little visibility due to the amount of rain.  I am drenched to the bone, shivering with cold, I'm moving at a snail's pace and stopping very often because I can't stand the cold. By the time I hit Sevilla,  I ask my partner to rescue me because I feel exhausted and the cold has taken over my body. In the afternoon we go to a supermarket and shelter in an area full of vans. We drink tea and rest all afternoon to warm us up while the storm shakes us and passes by wreaking and bringing chaos all over southern Andalusia.

<h3 id="-day-26---umbrete---port-de-huelva">  Day 26 - Umbrete - Port de Huelva:</h3>
<p align="justify">  
Last day before ending this adventure. It's not a sunny day,  but there's that post-storm peace in the air. As I face the first kilometers the cloudy sky fades and a blue sky makes way for me. I follow a flat road that runs through an extensive field of olive trees until I reach the village of Pilas. An hour later I switch to a quiet, lesser-known secondary road, passing scattered pine forests,  and I finally  enter the surroundings of the Doñana park. The GPS still has a little surprise for me and suggests that I take a sandy track that is getting narrower by the kilometer. Sand piles up, making it a struggle to pedal so I have to get off the bike constantly because the wheels keep sinking. Pushing through bushes and sand, I'm in my own little world on this isolated path away from everything. Eventually, I find a broader path beneath the high voltage lines and I follow it until I reach another gravel track. A few kilometers later I meet my partner where we have our last lunch in the van. There are only 20km left to reach the destination: the port of Huelva. After lunch I continue along roads flanked by strawberry fields and greenhouses. As I get near the port the landscape morphs into an industrial view: towering chimneys, pipes, smoke, steel structures, tanks and complex machinery paint the scene. With a big smile and full of joy I cross the police checkpoints and enter the port. There it is, the ferry that'll sail me into a whole new chapter of my life.
