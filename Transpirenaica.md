###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

<p align="justify">
Back in the summer of 2019, right after finishing my PhD and before diving into my first postdoc I had some spare time. That gap was the golden window to chase down one of my lifetime dreams: trekking across the Pyrenees, coast to coast.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I had to stop the trail when I was halfway. Nonetheless, the experience was worth it and I am very grateful for every bit of that wild and epic adventure.

### Day 1 - Llançà - Sant Quirze de Colera:


<p align="justify">We start the day at noon since getting to the starting point with public transportation was not an easy task. During a week, Marta, one of my best friends, will be hiking with me, together we will immerse ourselves in the first ascents of the Pyrenees. The starting point is  Llançà and we soon leave the asphalt roads and concrete buildings to climb up through sandy tracks that take us to Coll de les Portes. Then we go downhill to reach the  chapel of San Silvestre. The track ascends to Coll de la Serra and we go down again to pass through the town of Vilamaniscle and a patchwork of beautiful vinyards. The wide path continues passing through Mediterranean vegetation until we reach the monastery of Sant Quirze de Colera where we decided to spend the night. </p>

###  Day 2 - Sant Quirze de Colera - Voltants Requessens:

<p align="justify">This stage begins with a Mediterranean taste. We continue uphill passing through areas of bushes and with little shade. Then we have to follow a fairly boring stretch of road. We take a path that follows a stream and continue ascending until we reach a lush forest crowded by  holm oaks. From there we can still make out at the horizon the Mediterranean sea sending us as warm breeze just before dusk. There, near the Recassens castle, we spent the night under a leafy tree. </p>

###  Day 3 - Requessens - La Jonquera:
<p align="justify">


As dawn breaks, clouds start forming in the sky. We leave the forest behind and we ascend amidst bushes. Out of blue we bump into the remains of a plane that crashed in thw woods. As we go forward yellow flowers bloom all around adorning our path. Yet, the beauty and the fun  fades quickly as rain starts to pour down  dampening our spirits. We pass through a forested area devastated by the fire. Almost at the top, near the Coll de l'Auleda, a drenching rain leaves us soaken wet. We descending to La Jonquera where we look for a hotel to dry our clothes and spend a warm night. </p>

###   Day 4 - La Jonquera - Maçanet de Cabrenys:

<p align="justify">We wake up late and we quit La Jonquera around 10 am. There is no more rain but the sky is still  cloudy. We cross the urban area of the town and traverse the main highway that connects Spain and France. Then we start ascending through a forest full of cork oaks. Whispers of past fires are evident from scattered remnants.  We get to the town of La Vajol where we stop for lunch and found a bar to have a warm cup of coffe. It is time to go, we take a narrow and steep path under a lush forest that goes down until the vicinities of   Maçanet de Cabrenys. We pitched the tent there and I had a bad sleep because the wind was rough and the trees were squeaking the whole nigh.

###   Day 5 - Maçanet de Cabrenys - Refugi del Bassegoda Can Galan:

<p align="justify">
A gusty morning pushes the clouds away hints of clear sky emerge. We have breakfast  in Maçanet de Cabrenys, the town crowded with people on the streets due to Catalonia's elections. Ascending along a broad trail, a steady incline leads us to the Trilla ruins, where we stop for lunch. The descent weaves through tracks and pathways amidst pine forest and freshly cleared land, due to a recent deforestation. Eventually, we arrive at Albanyà, where we pause for a coffee and stock up on supplies before we undertake the final climb. A winding, narrow road guides us to the Bassegoda refuge, where we stop for the night, our first indoors since this trek began. </p>

###   Day 6 - Refugi del Bassegoda Can Galan - Beget:
<p align="justify">

Today we are stepping into one of the stages I've been eagerly waiting for – a dive into Alta Garrotxa's forests. We start ascending a steep path that guides us to the Bassegoda pass. From there we have spectacular views of the most imposing peaks in the area.  We go down a long, yet delightfully engaging trail, amidst green and rocky cliffs. Then we get to the chapel of Sant Aniol sorrounded by some ruins. </p>


![day6_Transpirenaica](/assets/img/Transpirenaica/day6.jpg "day6_Transpirenaica")


<p align="justify">
The path winds its way upward once more, leading us to Talaixa, crossing several streams and passing by forgotten huts and farm houses. Trekking through a patchwork of fields, dusk is approachinh so we opt to stop and pitch the tend.

###   Day 7 - Beget - Camprodon:
<p align="justify">  We wake up in a cold morning and decide to walk a couple of kilometers to get to Beget and have a warm breakfast in a cozy bar.  Beget is a very beautiful town but a bit too turistic. We follow the path but soon we need to leave the GR11 and join another track because today is  the last stage with Marta, so we need to reach Camprodon to get a bus to Barcelona. The path passes through lushy forests and it is mostly flat. Yet, we quickly switch to roads, a less scenic but necessary route. Pushing forward, we reach Camprodon just in time, catching the bus as planned, bidding farewell to this leg of the adventure with Marta.   </p>

###   Day 8 - Camprodon - Refugi d'Ulldeter:
<p align="justify">  A few days later,  my partner and I hop on a bus back to Camprodon, eager to resume this adventure.We cross the ancient bridge of Camprondon and we start hiking up a long path that passes through charming farmlands. Following the gentle course of the Ter river, we ascend gradually toward Setcases. The green lushly vegetation around us of the morning starts to fade as we face the last ascent.  The path steepens, transforming into a rocky ascent.  Trees are almost non existent when we reach the shelter of Ulldeter. There we make some tea and look at this rugged yet captivating landscape..
 </p>

###   Day 9 - Refugi d'Ulldeter - Queralbs:

<p align="justify">Waking to a blazing sunny day, we kick off our adventure ascending until we reach the coll de la Marrana with astonishing views. We are finally grasping taste of the high mountains of the Pyrenees. We cross many snow patches from the previous winter until we reach the majestic crown of peaks forming Olla de Núria. We walk along the ridge  encountering several iconic summits like Noucreus, la Vaca, and Noufonts, granting us panoramic views that unveil the beaury of the Pyrenees sprawling across the horizon. At the Noufonts summit we start going down the valley. It starts being a subtle path hidden beneath snow and boulders and slowly becomes a narrow sandy path that traverse the green grassy land of the Nuria valley.

<p align="justify">Leaving the Sanctuary in our wake, we continue our downhill journey. The trail traces the narrow Freser river valley. Then the  steep slopes gentle as we approach Queralbs, where we find another shelter to spend the night.  </p>

###   Day 10 - Queralbs - Puigcerdà:
<p align="justify">

The stage begins in the town of Queralbs, characterized by its Pyrenean charm. The path gently ascends amid fields and grazing lands. We pass by a stream and the Font de l'Home Mort. The track begins to go down and we quickly arrive at the town of Planoles. From there the path continues through a grassy valley near a busy road. We cross Dorria, the highest town in Catalonia and continue through a clear area with few trees. Further ahead we pass through the Coll de la Creu de Maians and Raso de la Basseta which are over 2000 meters. This is one of the longest stages and our legs are crying out to stop. Luckily, I enjoy the fabulous views at all times. There is only the last descent left, a long path between pines and fir trees takes us to Puigscerda where we will spend a few days to rest.
