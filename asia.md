###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

<p align="justify">  In late 2019 my partner and I went for a bold decision and decided to but a secondhand van. The new member of the family was a white Ford Transit that had been used for commercial shipping. I love designing things from the scratch and I had some basic knowledge on woodworking but zero experience on a van conversion. My partner did not have any experience either. This blog entry is not a "How to build a van" because there are many other sites and  tutorials that can show it in detailed and done it in a more professional way. Instead, I want to share our experience of buidling a van from the scratch, the problems we faced and the lesson we learned.

### Vietnam

<p align="justify"> One of the first steps when buidling a van is to install the windows. That was pretty scary because one of the first steops is cutting your own vehicle and you don't want anything to go wrong. I watch hundreds of YouTube tutorials on how to install a skyroof. The moment arrived and I used a jag saw? to remove a square piece of roof. The installation was pretty straightforeward but the weird shapes of the roof forced us to install the skyroof in the opposite direction it is supposed to be.
