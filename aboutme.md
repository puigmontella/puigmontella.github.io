###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

My name is Eduard Puig i Montellà. I am Civil Engineer graduated at Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). In 2014 I enrolled a Master in Hydraulics at Grenoble Institute of Technology, however, after having completed 7 years of high education, I still felt I had so much to learn. To this end, I decided to start a PhD at laboratory 3SR at the Grenoble-Alpes University in co-agreement with the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. My thesis is entitled “Micromechanics of multiphase flows in granular materials” and aimed to have a better understanding of water flow in unsaturated granular materials at the pore scale. I continued my research in LEGI lab. As a postdoc I focused on modelling sediment transport processes to better understand the particle-fluid interactions.

In my learning experience at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia I have enrolled on several courses related to water engineering, but it wasn’t until I followed that specialization track at Politecnico di Milano as part of an Exchange Program, that I realized I was in the right field. In Milan I focused on the scientific analysis of water management, water treatment and water dynamics. Besides, during my Erasmus program I had the chance to learn Italian. As a matter of fact, I have an innate interest in languages and in the cultures behind them, thus, living in different countries (Italy and France) has been a really fulfilling experience. Moreover, my hydraulic interests go further than that. As a former member of AUCOOP (Student Association for Cooperation of UPC) I worked on the design of a septic system that removes contaminants from wastewater in order to improve the quality of life of the population living in a rural community in Argentina. 

During my PhD and postdoc I had the chance to give some classes. I have always liked teaching but I was never in front of a class, thus I decided to go for it and step outside my comfort zone. Despite the difficult moments I experienced in the first classes, it turned out to be a great decision and I loved  teaching. I found that passing along the passion and curiosity to the students was, indeed, a very rewarding experience.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
