title: Building our dreamed van
###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

<p align="justify">  In late 2019 my partner and I went for a bold decision and decided to but a secondhand van. The new member of the family was a white Ford Transit that had been used for commercial shipping. We named our van **Mandalay**. </p>


 <p align="justify"> I love designing things from the scratch and I had some basic knowledge on woodworking but zero experience on a van conversion. My partner did not have any experience either. This blog entry is not a "How to build a van" because there are many other sites and  tutorials that can show it in detailed and done it in a more professional way. Instead, I want to share our experience of buidling a van from the scratch, the problems we faced and the lesson we learned.
 </p>



### Placing windows and skyroof.

<p align="justify"> One of the first steps when buidling a van is to install the windows. That was pretty scary because one of the first steops is cutting your own vehicle and you don't want anything to go wrong. I watch hundreds of YouTube tutorials on how to install a skyroof. The moment arrived and I used a jag saw? to remove a square piece of roof. The installation was pretty straightforeward but the weird shapes of the roof forced us to install the skyroof in the opposite direction it is supposed to be.

 <p align="justify"> The installation of the windows on the backdoors happened much later. Actually, we placed them almost at the end of the conversion and I could feel my confidence was much higher at the moment of making a hole in our van.

### Isolating the van and placing the floor
<p align="justify">
Isolating the van was probably the most boring and most demanding task of the conversion. I took me a whole week to attach the isolation on the walls due to complex shapes of our van. I realized that the beams, joints and the overall shape of the van was pretty complex compared to most of the vans people convert which usualy have a square cross section. Time passed by and finally the isolation was completed. Then, we placed wooden elements and plywood tables to even the floor. Finally, PVC elemens? were set on the floor.

### Framing the van and installing furniture
 <p align="justify">
Wood was placed, again, the curvy shape of our walls and ceiling was driving me crazy. Lots of planks and wooden elements had to be adjusted to fit nicely and optimize all the space. If we ever convert another van I will make sure it comes with a square cross section.

### Kitchen area
<p align="justify">
This part was the most fun one. We felt creative and we also had the experience of the previous months to tailor a kitchen that would fit our needs. We divided the kitchen counter in three areas, one for the fridge and external battery storage, one for the water tanks and one for food/kitchen tools. We opted for using both drawers and cupboards. I was in charge of the design and wood cutting whereas my partner was taking care of the polishing and paint. We assembled everything and anchored the big piece of furniture at the chassis of the van. We also placed a beautiful black sink and decided to go fancy and use tiles for the kitchen wall.  The installation of the water system was pretty simple:
