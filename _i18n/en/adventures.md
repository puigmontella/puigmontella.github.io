### Bikepacking from Grenoble to Tenerife:

<p align="justify">   In late summer of 2023 my life in Grenoble came to an end after so many years. I packed the most essential things in my bike bags and set out for a journey of 2400 kilometers. I decided not to take the easy road, instead, I took some detours to take a last glimpse of the breathtaking Alps, traversed the iconic lavender fields of Provence, caught up with friends in Marseille's bustling energy, flowed alongside the old boats of Canal du Midi, crossed the majestic Pyrenees, relaxed in my hometown near Barcelona, traced the stunning Mediterranean coastline, passed through Spain's most remote and unpopulated areas, meandered along winding paths amidst olive trees, finally reaching the port of Huelva. From there, I sailed off towards Tenerife, ready to embark on a new chapter of my life. </p> Click [here](../GrenobleTenerife) to find out all the details about my trip.

### Building our dreamed van:
<p align="justify"> Back in late 2019, my partner and I made a wild move. We decided to buy a secondhand van. The new member of the family was a white Ford Transit that we rescued from the commercial shipping business and we renamed it as Mandalay. I love designing things from the scratch, I'm quite handy and I had some basic knowledge on woodworking but zero experience on van conversion. My partner was in the same boat, no experience. This page ain't a classic "How to Build a Van" guide. There are loads of sites and tutorials out there that break it down step-by-step in a more professional way. Instead, I want to share our experience of building a van from scratch, the problems we faced, the mess-ups, and all the wisdom we picked up along the way.  </p> Click [here](../Mandalay) to find out how this experience turned out.

### Hiking the Pyrenees trail GR11:
<p align="justify"> In the summer of 2019, just after wrapping up my PhD and before I started my first postdoc, I found myself with some extra time on my hands. That gap became my golden opportunity to chase down a lifelong dream: trekking from one coast of the Pyrenees to the other. Unfortunately, I had to halt my journey halfway due to time limitations and personal reasons. Still, every moment of that wild, epic adventure was an absolute treasure. It was incredible witnessing the gradual shift from the Mediterranean landscape to towering rocky peaks, nights spent under the stars in stunning spots, hiking through valleys both familiar and unexplored... Each step was a glimpse into something extraordinary. </p> Click [here](../Transpirenaica) to find out all the details about my trip.

### Working in an indigenous community in northern Argentina:

<p align="justify"> In 2014 I had the opportunity to go to the north of Argentina to collaborate as a volunteer in an indigenous community. During my bachelor's years, I was part of a student association for international cooperation, and our university backed us with funds for technical and humanitarian ventures, promoting cultural ties and exchange. Thanks to this support, I traveled to the Bolivia-Argentina border. More specifically, in the Iguopeigenda community near the city of Oran. I had the chance to live firsthand the struggle of an indigenous community to claim their land and visit the most spectacular landscapes of northern Argentina. </p> Click [here](../argentina) to find out all the details about this experience.
