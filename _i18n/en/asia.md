<p align="justify"> One of the first steps when buidling a van is to install the windows. That was pretty scary because one of the first steops is cutting your own vehicle and you don't want anything to go wrong. I watch hundreds of YouTube tutorials on how to install a skyroof. The moment arrived and I used a jag saw? to remove a square piece of roof. The installation was pretty straightforeward but the weird shapes of the roof forced us to install the skyroof in the opposite direction it is supposed to be.
