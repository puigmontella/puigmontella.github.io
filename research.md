During my PhD and postdoc I had the chance to give some classes. I have always liked teaching but I was never in front of a class, thus I decided to go for it and step outside my comfort zone. Despite the difficult moments I experienced in the first classes, it turned out to be a great decision and I loved  teaching. I found that passing along the passion and curiosity to the students was, indeed, a very rewarding experience.  </p>

### My life beyond research

<p align="justify">  I love research but in my free time I also like to bike, climb go into the wilderness, spend some time with friends and do some woodwork. You can find out a bit more about my interests and hobbies clicking.  </p> [here](./GrenobleTenerife.md)
