###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

<p align="justify">  In late 2019 my partner and I went for a bold decision and decided to but a secondhand van. The new member of the family was a white Ford Transit that had been used for commercial shipping. I love designing things from the scratch and I had some basic knowledge on woodworking but zero experience on a van conversion. My partner did not have any experience either. This blog entry is not a "How to build a van" because there are many other sites and  tutorials that can show it in detailed and done it in a more professional way. Instead, I want to share our experience of buidling a van from the scratch, the problems we faced and the lesson we learned.
