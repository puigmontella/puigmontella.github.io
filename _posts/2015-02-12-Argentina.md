<p align="justify"> In 2014 I had the opportunity to go to the north of Argentina to collaborate as a volunteer in an indigenous community. During my bachelor's years, I was part of a student association for international cooperation, and our university backed us with funds for technical and humanitarian ventures, promoting cultural ties and exchange. Thanks to this support, I traveled to the Bolivia-Argentina border. More specifically, in the Iguopeigenda community near the city of Oran. I had the chance to live firsthand the struggle of an indigenous community to claim their land and visit the most spectacular landscapes of northern Argentina. </p> Click [here](../argentina) to find out all the details about this experience.
