<p align="justify">  In late summer of 2023 my life in Grenoble came to an end after so many years. I packed the most essential things in my bike bags and set out for a journey of 2400 kilometers. I decided not to take the easy road, instead, I took some detours to take a last glimpse of the breathtaking Alps, traversed the iconic lavender fields of Provence, caught up with friends in Marseille's bustling energy, flowed alongside the old boats of Canal du Midi, crossed the majestic Pyrenees, relaxed in my hometown near Barcelona, traced the stunning Mediterranean coastline, passed through Spain's most remote and unpopulated areas, meandered along winding paths amidst olive trees, finally reaching the port of Huelva. From there, I sailed off towards Tenerife, ready to embark on a new chapter of my life.</p> Click [here](../GrenobleTenerife) to find out all the details about my trip.
