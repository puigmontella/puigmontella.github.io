<p align="justify">   In the summer of 2019, just after wrapping up my PhD and before I start my first postdoc, I found myself with some extra time on my hands. That  gap became my golden opportunity to chase down a lifelong dream: trekking from one coast of the Pyrenees to the other. Unfortunately, I had to halt my journey halfway due to time limitations. Still, every moment of that wild, epic adventure was an absolute treasure. It was incredible witnessing the gradual shift from the Mediterranean landscape to towering rocky peaks, nights spent under the stars in stunning spots, hiking through valleys both familiar and unexplored... Each step was a glimpse into something extraordinary. </p> Click [here](../Transpirenaica) to find out all the details about my trip.
