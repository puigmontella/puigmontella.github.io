Back in late 2019, my partner and I made a wild move. We decided to buy a secondhand van. The new member of the family was a white Ford Transit that we rescued from the commercial shipping business and we renamed as **Mandalay**.  I love designing things from the scratch, I'm quite handy and  I had some basic knowledge on woodworking but zero experience on a van conversion. My partner was in the same boat, no experience. This page ainâ€™t a classic "How to Build a Van" guide. There are loads of sites and tutorials out there that break it down step-by-step in a more professional way.  Instead, I want to share our experience of buidling a van from the scratch, the problems we faced, the mess-ups, and all the wisdom we picked up along the way.  Click [here](../Mandalay) to find out how this experienced turned out.
