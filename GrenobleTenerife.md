title: Bikepacking from Grenoble to Tenerife
###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

<p align="justify">  In the late summer of 2023 I decided to move to Tenerife with my partner. I have lived in Grenoble for the last 8 years and I thought that the best way to move to Tenerife was to embark on a journey of 2400km by bicycle. This trip gifted me countless memories and adventure and I tried to capture some of them in this website. </p> For those seeking more detailed info, GPS tracks and full path everything is available  [here](https://www.komoot.com/collection/2440416/-grenoble-el-masnou-tenerife) .

### Day 1 - Grenoble - Dévoluy:


<p align="justify"> Grenoble, home for the last 8 years, is my starting point. Following the Drag river upstream, I leave behind both mountains and memories. The unbroken heat and slope persist until I reach Lac de Monteynard. From there I can still see the most emblematic peaks of Vercors and Chartreuse, faithful companions throughout my years in Grenoble. The familiar silhouettes of Sénépy, Peyrouse, and Mont Aiguille fade into the distance. I stop near La Mure to have lunch and start the first descent that helps me regain my strength to face the rest of the ascent. I pass near the lac du Sautet and the sunlight begins to recede. The last climb of the day goes through a wide valley between the giants of the Obiou and the Pierroux peak. Half way up my legs are still full of energy but the darkness halts my progress and I decide to camp in the middle of the vallée du Dévoluy.  </p>

###  Day 2 - Dévoluy - Lac de Serre-Ponçon:


<p align="justify">
I kickstart the day quite late, feeling the relentless sun on me since the beginning. After an hour of climbing, I reach the col du Festre. I have about 20 km of downhill ahead of me, which brings a big smile in my face. I go at full speed through the last gray and rocky peaks of the massif of Dévoluy.  I opt for lesser-traveled roads to bypass Gap, following the course of La Durancel river.  My legs are exhausted and my back hurts but I still have one last climb to reach the campsite near Lac de Serre-Ponçon. Besides, the climb is full of cars and motorbikers that make me a little nervous. Fortunately, I make it without problems and reach the destination before the orange glow of the evening fades out.  </p>

###  Day 3 - Lac de Serre-Ponçon - Mezel:
<p align="justify"> The day kicks off with an intense ascent. Two hours of battling the sun, sweat, and hard work lead me to the pass marking the start of the Alpes de l'Haute-Provence natural park. Lunchtime arrives near Le Grand Puy ski resort, offering a breathtaking view of Roche Close and la Mournière peaks. After an energetic meal, it's time to descend. The way ahead is a long road winding through mountains and gorges. I pass through the awe-inspiring stone formations of Clues de Barles, sculpted by water across millennia. Then I reach Digne-les-Bains in search of accommodation. Disappointed by the options, I opt to push forward. Ten kilometers later, I stumble upon a motocross circuit bustling with vans that welcomed me and offered me a spot to spend the night.   </p>

###   Day 4 - Mezel - Correns:

<p align="justify"> Today's  route starts amidst lavender fields. Though they're not fully in bloom, leaving behind the alpine vegetation for the iconic landscapes of Provence fills me with excitement. A ard and steep ascent towards the village of Saint-Jurs serves as a reminder of the many kilometers my legs have completed in recent days, discouraging me from seeking more mountain peaks. Crossing endless fields of lavender, my excitement gradually wanes and it is replaced by a sense of monotony as the scenery repeats itself for hours and kilometers. Eventually, my route culminates at Lac de Sainte-Croix in the heart of the Verdon natural park. Although it's hard, I manage to find a shaded spot to enjoy lunch. The landscapes I traverse in the afternoon, while slightly less spectacular, still carry the unique charm of Provence. I decide to do the last 10 kilometers on a sandy track through a sparsely forested area resembling a savanna. There are more and more rocks and the rear wheel gives up... First flat tire of the trip! After changing it, a mere kilometer later, another puncture deflates my hopes. Choosing not to rush, I decide to cover the final 3 kilometers on foot beside my bike as the campsite where I plan to sleep is nearby. I arrive almost at dusk but with enough time to inspect the wheel and fix the puncture with more peace of mind. </p>

###   Day 5 - Correns - Marseille:

<p align="justify"> I depart from Correns, following a road alongside the L'Argens river, enjoying the last moments of serene nature before the bustling metropolis of Marseille. The roads and streets are becoming more and more busy and cars are everywhere. I notice the contrast to the tranquility of the Alps from the previous days as I traverse the northern part of the Sainte-Baume natural park. Despite sporadic wooded areas and vineyards, I don't have the same feeling of stillness and tranquility as in the Alps. A seemingly endless ascent leads me to the village of Cassis, marking the gateway to the renowned Calanques park, my final route to Marseille. Despite its natural status, the park is congested with cars and motorbikes, making the scenic coastal journey a bit too stressful. Luckily, this area is familiar to me, and I’m aware that only a few kilometers stand between me and the center of Marseille, where a well-deserved shower and a comfortable bed await my arrival. </p>

###   Day 6 - Marseille - Salin-de-Girau:
<p align="justify"> After a few days of rest, I've regained my strength. Plus, in the upcoming days I will be accompanied by one of my best friends and not much elevation gain is expected before the Pyrenees. Today is not a day with much nature, it's all about navigating away from Marseille's urban sprawl. We pass through small hills leading to Berre Lake. This lake is heavily urbanized — if not houses, then industries dominate.  To get away from the busiest roads we decide to take paths that cross some salt ponds. It's not the fastest, but the journey becomes more entertaining and safer. Despite the stagnant water's smell, we choose to eat lunch by the ponds; it's preferable to be amidst flamingos and stinky ponds than next to a busy national road. In the afternoon, we are forced to pedal alongside a road crowded with trucks until we reach the Rhône river's mouth. A free ferry for cyclists brings us to the other side, where the Camargue region begins and we find a calm spot to spend the night. </p>

###   Day 7 - Salin-de-Giraud - Montpellier:
<p align="justify"> We set out in the morning crossing rice fields and pools of water full of flamingos. We expected a more diverse landscape, yet the delta's sight is monotonous as the day goes on, despite the favorable wind and minimal elevation gain of no more than 50 meters. Fortunately,  after lunch we come across the Canal du Rhône à Sète,  which brings us to a different scenery: cycling paths, old boats, and a sun that had been hidden during the early morning. Following the canal, we reach Aigues-Mortes, a fortified town surrounded by canals and Rhône's ponds. Passing through, we join the Eurovelo 8 route, a cycling path that runs along the coast of the European side of the  Mediterranean sea. For approximately 10 kilometers, we traverse a coastal bar  that lies between the Mediterranean Sea and the Estany d'Or to finally enter the metropolitan area of Montpellier.

###   Day 8 - Montpellier - Capestang::
<p align="justify">  After a day of rest in Montpellier, my father joins me and my friend Marta heads back home. Heading south, we traverse coastal bars along sandy and gravel paths that run between waters. Much of the morning is spent following these paths, flanked by the Mediterranean on the left and several salt and marine ponds on the right. It's very windy but most of the time it is tailwind and helps us reach the touristic city of Sète without much effort. There, we stop for a while near the fort of Saint-Pierre where we recover our strength while watching the waves break against the rocks and the walls of the fort. Continuing along the coast, we pass various beaches until reaching Agde, where we pause for lunch. A few droplets fall in the afternoon, but they do not prevent us from continuing and climbing the path that follows alongside Canal du Midi. We cross vineyards, many locks, several bridges and leave behind boats that navigate the canal to finally arrive at the Capestang campsite where we spend the night.</p>
