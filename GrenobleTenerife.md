title: Bikepacking from Grenoble to Tenerife
###subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

<p align="justify">  In the late summer of 2023 I decided to move to Tenerife with my partner. I have lived in Grenoble for the last 8 years and I thought that the best way to move to Tenerife was to embark on a journey of 2400km by bicycle. This trip gifted me countless memories and adventure and I tried to capture some of them in this website. </p> For those seeking more detailed info, GPS tracks and full path everything is available  [here](https://www.komoot.com/collection/2440416/-grenoble-el-masnou-tenerife) .

### Day 1 - Grenoble - Dévoluy:


<p align="justify"> Grenoble, home for the last 8 years, is my starting point. Following the Drag river upstream, I leave behind both mountains and memories. The unbroken heat and slope persist until I reach Lac de Monteynard. From there I can still see the most emblematic peaks of Vercors and Chartreuse, faithful companions throughout my years in Grenoble. The familiar silhouettes of Sénépy, Peyrouse, and Mont Aiguille fade into the distance. I stop near La Mure to have lunch and start the first descent that helps me regain my strength to face the rest of the ascent. I pass near the lac du Sautet and the sunlight begins to recede. The last climb of the day goes through a wide valley between the giants of the Obiou and the Pierroux peak. Half way up my legs are still full of energy but the darkness halts my progress and I decide to camp in the middle of the vallée du Dévoluy.  </p>

###  Day 2 - Dévoluy - Lac de Serre-Ponçon:


<p align="justify">
I kickstart the day quite late, feeling the relentless sun on me since the beginning. After an hour of climbing, I reach the col du Festre. I have about 20 km of downhill ahead of me, which brings a big smile in my face. I go at full speed through the last gray and rocky peaks of the massif of Dévoluy.  I opt for lesser-traveled roads to bypass Gap, following the course of La Durancel river.  My legs are exhausted and my back hurts but I still have one last climb to reach the campsite near Lac de Serre-Ponçon. Besides, the climb is full of cars and motorbikers that make me a little nervous. Fortunately, I make it without problems and reach the destination before the orange glow of the evening fades out.  </p>

###  Day 3 - Lac de Serre-Ponçon - Mezel:
<p align="justify"> The day kicks off with an intense ascent. Two hours of battling the sun, sweat, and hard work lead me to the pass marking the start of the Alpes de l'Haute-Provence natural park. Lunchtime arrives near Le Grand Puy ski resort, offering a breathtaking view of Roche Close and la Mournière peaks. After an energetic meal, it's time to descend. The way ahead is a long road winding through mountains and gorges. I pass through the awe-inspiring stone formations of Clues de Barles, sculpted by water across millennia. Then I reach Digne-les-Bains in search of accommodation. Disappointed by the options, I opt to push forward. Ten kilometers later, I stumble upon a motocross circuit bustling with vans that welcomed me and offered me a spot to spend the night.   </p>

###   Day 4 - Mezel - Correns:

<p align="justify"> Today's  route starts amidst lavender fields. Though they're not fully in bloom, leaving behind the alpine vegetation for the iconic landscapes of Provence fills me with excitement. A ard and steep ascent towards the village of Saint-Jurs serves as a reminder of the many kilometers my legs have completed in recent days, discouraging me from seeking more mountain peaks. Crossing endless fields of lavender, my excitement gradually wanes and it is replaced by a sense of monotony as the scenery repeats itself for hours and kilometers. Eventually, my route culminates at Lac de Sainte-Croix in the heart of the Verdon natural park. Although it's hard, I manage to find a shaded spot to enjoy lunch. The landscapes I traverse in the afternoon, while slightly less spectacular, still carry the unique charm of Provence. I decide to do the last 10 kilometers on a sandy track through a sparsely forested area resembling a savanna. There are more and more rocks and the rear wheel gives up... First flat tire of the trip! After changing it, a mere kilometer later, another puncture deflates my hopes. Choosing not to rush, I decide to cover the final 3 kilometers on foot beside my bike as the campsite where I plan to sleep is nearby. I arrive almost at dusk but with enough time to inspect the wheel and fix the puncture with more peace of mind. </p>

###   Day 5 - Correns - Marseille:

<p align="justify"> I depart from Correns, following a road alongside the L'Argens river, enjoying the last moments of serene nature before the bustling metropolis of Marseille. The roads and streets are becoming more and more busy and cars are everywhere. I notice the contrast to the tranquility of the Alps from the previous days as I traverse the northern part of the Sainte-Baume natural park. Despite sporadic wooded areas and vineyards, I don't have the same feeling of stillness and tranquility as in the Alps. A seemingly endless ascent leads me to the village of Cassis, marking the gateway to the renowned Calanques park, my final route to Marseille. Despite its natural status, the park is congested with cars and motorbikes, making the scenic coastal journey a bit too stressful. Luckily, this area is familiar to me, and I’m aware that only a few kilometers stand between me and the center of Marseille, where a well-deserved shower and a comfortable bed await my arrival. </p>


![day5_bikeGreTen](/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day5.jpg "day5_bikeGreTen")


###   Day 6 - Marseille - Salin-de-Girau:
<p align="justify"> After a few days of rest, I've regained my strength. Plus, in the upcoming days I will be accompanied by one of my best friends and not much elevation gain is expected before the Pyrenees. Today is not a day with much nature, it's all about navigating away from Marseille's urban sprawl. We pass through small hills leading to Berre Lake. This lake is heavily urbanized — if not houses, then industries dominate.  To get away from the busiest roads we decide to take paths that cross some salt ponds. It's not the fastest, but the journey becomes more entertaining and safer. Despite the stagnant water's smell, we choose to eat lunch by the ponds; it's preferable to be amidst flamingos and stinky ponds than next to a busy national road. In the afternoon, we are forced to pedal alongside a road crowded with trucks until we reach the Rhône river's mouth. A free ferry for cyclists brings us to the other side, where the Camargue region begins and we find a calm spot to spend the night. </p>


![day6_bikeGreTen](/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day6.jpg "day6_bikeGreTen")


###   Day 7 - Salin-de-Giraud - Montpellier:
<p align="justify"> We set out in the morning crossing rice fields and pools of water full of flamingos. We expected a more diverse landscape, yet the delta's sight is monotonous as the day goes on, despite the favorable wind and minimal elevation gain of no more than 50 meters. Fortunately,  after lunch we come across the Canal du Rhône à Sète,  which brings us to a different scenery: cycling paths, old boats, and a sun that had been hidden during the early morning. Following the canal, we reach Aigues-Mortes, a fortified town surrounded by canals and Rhône's ponds. Passing through, we join the Eurovelo 8 route, a cycling path that runs along the coast of the European side of the  Mediterranean sea. For approximately 10 kilometers, we traverse a coastal bar  that lies between the Mediterranean Sea and the Estany d'Or to finally enter the metropolitan area of Montpellier.
 </p>

###   Day 8 - Montpellier - Capestang:
<p align="justify">  After a day of rest in Montpellier, my father joins me and my friend Marta heads back home. Heading south, we traverse coastal bars along sandy and gravel paths that run between waters. Much of the morning is spent following these paths, flanked by the Mediterranean on the left and several salt and marine ponds on the right. It's very windy but most of the time it is tailwind and helps us reach the touristic city of Sète without much effort. There, we stop for a while near the fort of Saint-Pierre where we recover our strength while watching the waves break against the rocks and the walls of the fort. Continuing along the coast, we pass various beaches until reaching Agde, where we pause for lunch. A few droplets fall in the afternoon, but they do not prevent us from continuing and climbing the path that follows alongside Canal du Midi. We cross vineyards, many locks, several bridges and leave behind boats that navigate the canal to finally arrive at the Capestang campsite where we spend the night.</p>


![day8_bikeGreTen](/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day8.jpg "day8_bikeGreTen")




###   Day 9 - Capestang - Tautavel:
<p align="justify">  I am alone again but I am accompanied by a breeze that pushes me during the first kilometers. Although my initial plan was to spend the day on the Canal du Midi in the direction of Carcassonne, I opt for a change and head south, facing the first hills that precede the Pyrenees. The day advances between secondary roads that lead me through changing landscapes, from vineyards, castles, canyons and striking rock formations. As evening approaches, the winding path leads me amidst small hills and karst structures, offering a glimpse of the Pyrenees' silhouette emerging on the distant horizon. </p>


![day9_bikeGreTen](/assets/img/BikeGrenobleTenerife/day9.jpg "day9_bikeGreTen")

###   Day 10 - Tautavel - Roquefort-de-Sault:
<p align="justify">  
I resume my journey along a narrow road that winds through vineyards.  It is harvest time and there are many people in a region that is usually empty.  The first kilometers are pleasant, surrounded by the green vineyards and the emblematic views of the castle of Quéribus located on a very steep rocky peak. By mid-morning, I merge onto a busier road, a straight line of 40 kilometers where the only attraction is the red train of the pays Cathare et du Fenouillèdes. In addition, a relentless headwind drains me both physically and mentally. I pause in Axat for lunch and recharge my body.  I realize that I have to reconsider the route since I don't have much time or strength left to get where I had planned. Just 10 kilometers remain, unfortunately, they're all uphill.  I cross the gorges of Saint Georges and continue to climb between cliffs and rocks . My legs  tell me they had  enough and ask me  to stop. Eventually, I reach Roquefort-de-Sault safely, finding myself the only person at the deserted campsite.
 </p>

###   Day 11 - Roquefort-de-Sault - Llo:
<p align="justify">  
I wake up with more energy than yesterday to face the second stage of the Pyrenees. The day begins foggy and I slowly climb up to the col du Garavel. The reward? Some downhill curves that give me rest and a touch of amusement.  The fun ends soon and a long ascent awaits me without compassion. The road, despite being quite wide, it's not very busy, allowing me to climb at my own pace and take breaks whenever I need to. The path winds between mountains following the upstream course of the Aude river until reaching the Puyvalador reservoir. From there the slope softens and the road  opens into a broad valley  that passes through numerous coniferous forests.
 Eventually, the road  takes me to the lake of Matermale where I stop for a well-deserved lunch. The fog continues but is not dense enough to hide the beauty of the Pyrenees. I decide to go around the lake on a sandy path and tackle the last climb of the day. The fog begins to disappear and from the highest point, at the Quillana pass, I have breathtaking views of the Puigmal and the rest of the peaks of the olla de Núria. I go down the streets and roads that pass through Llo. Eventually I reach the campsite exhausted. The fog returns and I realize I made the mistake of not putting sun cream so my whole face is burnt...
 </p>

###   Day 12 - Llo - Ripoll:
<p align="justify">  
Today is the last day of my Pyrenees adventure but I still have the highest and probably most spectacular mountain passes. The stage begins bordering agricultural fields and I continue to pedal through the wide valley that takes me to Puigcerdà and Alp where I have to stop to buy food. I return to the road and begin the ascent to La Molina along a road that I have done many times by car but it is unexplored by bike. The side of the road is narrow and despite not being a very busy place I do not fully enjoy the environment due to the traffic of passing cars.  However, near La Molina I can take paths further away from the traffic and enjoy the splendid views of the Pyrenees. Once I leave the ski resort of La Molina behind I head towards the Creueta pass, a demanding and long climb.  Yet, the sunny day eases the ascent while I contemplate the  grassy rugged mountains and a couple of marmots pop out to greet me. The descent is beautiful and delights me with views of the sea of mountains of Ripollès and Berguedà. While I am having fun on the way down, I halt abruptly at the awe-inspiring sight of Pedraforca's imposing silhouette. The snaky curves continue and I leave behind Castellar de n'Hug, Gombren, Campdevanol to finally reach Ripoll. I finish the day with exhausted legs but  my heart overflows with joy from experiencing such a magnificent stage.
 </p>

###   Day 13 - Ripoll - El Masnou:
<p align="justify">  
I get up early, it's still dark but I have a long day ahead of me today. I set out on a route following the course of the Ter and detour along small paths to avoid taking a road congested with cars and trucks. The path becomes steeper and steeper and  more rocks pop up to the point that  I find myself getting off the bike and pushing my bike through this arduous terrain. This scene repeats relentlessly for what feels like eternal 5 kilometers. It takes me more than an hour and a half to complete them. Plus, an electrified fence to keep the herd protected gives me an intense electric shock. I decide that I've had enough and that no matter how beautiful the trail and the surroundings are, I'm not moving forward and I make the questionable decision to join the major road C-17 for a little distance to save myself from that horrible mountain roller coaster. Once off the C-17, I merge with a parallel road that runs through crops and livestock fields until I reach Vic where my father joins me  for the final kilometers. When we approach the Montseny massif, we take a path that crosses the gorge between Tagamanent and Figaró, which gives us a changing scenery from wide tracks of reddish earth to narrow paths that cross the river continuously. As we reach Granollers, the  green woods fade away, replaced by the gray of concrete. The road takes us to the canalization of Besos river that we follow downstream until we reach the Mediterranean sea. From there we follow the coastline path that I have  traveled countless times. We eventually arrive at my parents' home, where I'll spend the coming days recuperating and processing all I've experienced.
 </p>

###   Day 14 - El Masnou - Sitges:
<p align="justify">  
Two weeks later I resume the route to the south, today with my father as my cycling partner. The first hour consists of following the coastline cycle way towards Barcelona. We go through the Forum and follow the various cycle paths that border the touristic beaches of Barcelona. We cross the port and turn up Parallel street and then go along a busy road to Hospitalet de Llobregat. Then we follow the path that runs parallel to the Llobregat river. We start a mountainous ascent on sandy paths that become more and more technical and steeper. At some points, the terrain is so demanding that we need to jump off the bike and push them. We pass through Begues, marking our entry into the Garraf natural park. Here, we traverse sandy  tracks and secondary roads as we pedal between limestone rocks, Mediterranean vegetation, and the distant sight of the sea on the horizon. Descending along wide tracks, we eventually reach Sitges, where we reward ourselves with a well-deserved beer.

The sea is rough and furious but I am feeling calm and full of joy after have accomplished such an adventure. After 2400km, going up and down three times the mount Everest and just two flat tyres I finaly reach Tenerife. Thanks Lau, Gus, Xuanning, Marta, Núria, papa, mama, Maria, Cristóbal, Rosa, Tuca, Alma, Júlia, Jose, Jan, Joel, Mandalay, Alba and all the people that in some way or another have helped me in my journey to Tenerife.
